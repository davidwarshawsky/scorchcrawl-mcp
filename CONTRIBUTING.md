# Contributing guidelines

When changing service ports, reverse-proxy settings, or CI expectations please:

- Keep `docker-compose.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, and `docs/architecture.md` in sync.
- If you change MCP or API ports update all three places (compose defaults, CI, and nginx docs).
- Run the config consistency check locally before opening a PR:

```bash
# from repo root
grep "${MCP_PORT:-24787}" docker-compose.yaml && grep "${SCORCHCRAWL_API_URL:-http://localhost:24786}" docker-compose.yaml
```

- Run unit and integration tests as documented in `README.md` and the `server` package.

- When cutting a new release, bump the `version` fields in `client/package.json` and `server/package.json`, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the git tag, build/push the Docker image, and update documentation (README, architecture, reverse-proxy) with the new tag or "latest" instructions.

- Ensure the scorchcrawl-mcp CONTRIBUTING.md stays in line with scorchcrawl's CONTRIBUTING.md. Any changes to versioning, release process, or Docker image publishing should be mirrored in both repos.

Thanks for keeping the infra consistent — small mismatches cause confusing runtime errors behind reverse proxies.

Note: ScorchCrawl-MCP's MCP server uses the GitHub Copilot/Copilot-Agent integration (via `GITHUB_TOKEN`/agent settings) by default.
